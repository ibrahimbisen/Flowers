                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                The purpose of this chapter is to explore how COVID-19 has widened the achievement gap between students 
                of different socioeconomic statuses. The chapter will demonstrate that students from lower socioeconomic
                 classes received lower-quality education than students from higher socioeconomic situations who in some
                  instances received an even better education than they had pre-pandemic face-to-face learning. These 
                  widening achievement gaps along with chronic absenteeism and lower student motivation are some of the 
                  biggest problems that the pandemic has brought to online education. This chapter goes on to explore how 
                  to remedy some of these problems. By fixing these issues, online learning and even education as a whole
                   can emerge stronger than it was before the disruption of COVID-19.

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                Covid-19 Pandemic has created a consolidation of the education and the technology sector, which has led
                to the transition into online learning. Within the last two years, teachers and students were able to
                observe the short-term benefits and detriments of distanced-online education. Categorizing the effects
                of this new normal for student’ education can be looked at through four primary lenses; personal,
                social, educational, and technological. Wherever we criticize online education, there are myriad
                advantages, from convenience and flexibility to cost. However, within the ephemeral struggles of this
                rapid transition, student bodies and faculty members started raising doubts about its major efficiency,
                self-regulation skills, and mental health setbacks. Even after we aggregate the potential benefits of
                online education, we need to consider its human aspect. With the correct and reliable allocation of
                resources combined with advancements from artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art automation, we
                will manage to pave the way for perfect hybrid education.

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been implemented successfully in many industries, from
                virtual hospital assistants to algorithm-based warehouse processing. And now that Covid-19 has forced
                students and teachers to transition to online or hybrid learning, these technologies could offer new and
                exciting possibilities for education as well. By incorporating AI and machine learning tools into online
                classrooms, educators can address many of the challenges that have emerged with the recent loss of
                face-to-face instruction, including the struggle for students to self-regulate their learning, the
                burden of curriculum planning and administrative work for teachers, and the loss of personalized
                interaction between students and teachers. This chapter will explore some of the AI technologies that
                have been used in educational contexts and describe applications of AI in other industries that could be
                adapted to create more personalized, flexible, inclusive, and engaging learning experiences. If the
                future of education is going to include online learning as a substantial component, then AI could be the
                key to maintaining high levels of motivation and engagement from students and teachers alike.

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                The neologism of artificial intelligence and machine learning brought a myriad of conveniences and
                advantages into the education sector. These new and improved technologies have the potential to be the
                remedies to the predicaments that have emerged from the rapid transition into online learning and the
                problems that have existed with traditional learning. These predicaments vary from personalized learning
                experiences, administrative busy works, to increased overall student interaction. This article explores
                how artificial intelligence became the new normal in education and the recently revealed benefits of
                artificial intelligence and machine learning in developing automated solutions to these predicaments
                such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), dynamic schedules, automated grading, and increased
                personalized student interaction through chat-bots. Along with these solutions, some of the economical
                advancements that these technologies will bring include new research and investments in AI development,
                data collection and understanding, and increased jobs. These advancements are on a massive scale and
                will need to be addressed. By accommodating our resources into the advancements in this area we can make
                our education more versatile, engaging, and inclusive.

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to address many of
                the problems that have emerged in higher education due the rapid and haphazard
                transition to online learning brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. These
                problems include students’ struggle to self-regulate their learning, the increase
                in curriculum planning and administrative workload for teachers, and the loss of
                personalized interaction between students and teachers. This chapter explores how
                artificial intelligence can be used to help students and teachers to adapt to the new
                realities of online learning, and how these technologies could further transform
                higher education in the future. By providing more personalized, flexible, inclusive,
                and engaging learning experiences, artificial intelligence has the potential to
                re-invigorate students and teachers both and to make virtual classrooms more
                meaningful and productive.
